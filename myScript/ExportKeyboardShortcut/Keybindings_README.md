# myScript/ExportKeyboardShortcut/

This directory contains scripts and configuration files for managing custom keyboard shortcuts, specifically designed for a Linux desktop environment (likely GNOME or a similar XDG-compliant system).

## Purpose:
- `Export|Load_Keybindings.sh`: This Bash script is designed to automate the process of exporting current keyboard shortcuts to a file and loading them from a file. This is useful for backing up configurations or transferring them between systems.
- `custom-keybindings.conf`: This file stores the actual custom keybinding configurations in a format readable by the `Export|Load_Keybindings.sh` script. It's the primary configuration file for the shortcuts.
- `custom-keybindings-string.txt`: This file might contain a raw string representation of the keybindings, possibly used as an intermediate format during export or import operations.

## Guidelines:
- **Execution**: Ensure the `Export|Load_Keybindings.sh` script has executable permissions (`chmod +x Export|Load_Keybindings.sh`) before running it.
- **Backup**: Always back up your current system's keybindings before attempting to load new ones using the script to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Editing `custom-keybindings.conf`**: If you need to manually modify keybindings, understand the specific syntax and structure required by your desktop environment's keybinding system to avoid errors. Refer to your desktop environment's documentation for details.
- **Compatibility**: These scripts are tailored for specific system configurations. Verify compatibility if using them on a different Linux distribution or desktop environment.
