# myScript/

This directory contains various personal scripts for automating tasks and managing system configurations.

## Guidelines:
- Each script should ideally be self-contained or clearly document its dependencies.
- Provide comments within scripts for clarity.
- Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x script_name.sh`).
