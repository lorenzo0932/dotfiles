# myScript/search&Convert/

This directory contains Bash scripts designed for searching, converting, and verifying video files. These scripts automate the process of finding specific video content and transforming it into desired formats, often with integrity checks.

## Purpose:
- `search&Convert.sh`: This script is responsible for searching for video files based on specified criteria (e.g., file type, location) and then initiating a conversion process for the found files. It streamlines bulk video processing.
- `Converti e verifica.sh`: This utility script is called by `search&Convert.sh` (or can be used independently) to convert video files to a target format (e.g., H.265) and then verify their integrity after conversion. It ensures that the converted files are not corrupted.

## Guidelines:
- **Configuration**: Before running `search&Convert.sh`, review its content to understand the search parameters (e.g., target directories, file extensions) and the conversion settings.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system, as it is essential for the video conversion and verification processes performed by `Converti e verifica.sh`.
- **Permissions**: Ensure both scripts have executable permissions (`chmod +x search&Convert.sh` and `chmod +x Converti e verifica.sh`).
- **Output Location**: Be aware of where the converted files will be saved. The scripts should clearly define the output directory.
- **Error Handling**: The `Converti e verifica.sh` script includes error handling for failed conversions or verifications. Monitor the script's output for any issues.
